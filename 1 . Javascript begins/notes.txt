what is javascript 
    Javasccript is a lightweight, cross-platform, object-oriented programming language.
    Javascript is one of the three core technologies of web development.

    Today javascript can be used in different places:
        - client-side : Javacript was traditionally only used in browser
        - server - side : thanks to node.js, we can use javascript on the server as well

    javascript is what made modern development possible.

                variable s and data types
variable:
    variable is a like container which we can store our data and we can use it over and over again
Data types:
    Number
    String
    Boolean
    Undefined :-> variable does not have value yet
    Null :-> non existent data

***** Javascript has dynamic typing: data types are automatically assigned to variables. ***********
